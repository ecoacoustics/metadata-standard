# Naming and Terminology

## Terms

- **Unit**: A unit of measurement.
- **Value**: A quantity measured with a unit.
- **Field**: A measurement of a value. A field and a **column** in spreadsheet
  can be considered equivalent.

## Field naming

Field names use what's commonly called _snake_case_.
_snake_case_ names should be lowercase and have words separated by underscores
(the `_` symbol).

Fields should ideally never abbreviations and should strive to be descriptive.

Examples:

Good:

- `distance` - in cases where the unit is defined in a standard such as this
- `distance_meters`

Bad:

- `Distance_Meters`
- `distance meters`
- `Distance Meters`
- `DistanceMeters`
- `distanceMeters`
- `distM`
- `dist_m`
- `distance_m`
- `dist`
- `dist_meters`
- `DISTANCE`
- `DISTANCE_METERS`
